# Consumer Goods Ad-hoc Analysis (SQL)

This project was created as part of the **Codebasis Resume Challenge**.

AtliQ Hardwares is a product-based company that sells computers, accessories, and peripherals to customers across the globe. Recently, the management team realized they lack the data-driven insights needed to make fast and effective decisions. In order to strengthen their analytics capability, they plan to expand the team by hiring junior data analysts.

Tony Sharma, the Director of Data Analytics, designed a SQL challenge to assess both the technical proficiency and soft skills of potential candidates.
